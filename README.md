# Porn Is Dangerous

But you know that already; that's why you're here. This guidance is designed for the non tech savvy of you who want to employ best practises to protect yourself from the devestating impact of porn.

## Barriers are Best Practise

Self control is hard, so to improve your odds, we introduce barriers. Barriers:
* Are technical roadblocks or obstacles which are designed to force you to check yourself
* Are *not "silver bullets"*: they can be circumvented. Self control is still required.
* Give you the opportunity to exit from your thinking pattern so you can go an do something else, call a friend or spend time with your wife/partner and avoid porn.

# Content Filtering / Parental Controls can help

One of the easiest things you can do is to impose on yourself content filtering by using commonly available parental control services. The trick is to add this barrier to all devices you might access the internet from. When we're at home, we connect to the internet through our home wifi or our phone's internet connection/plan. If you're serious about putting a barrier using content filtering you'll try to filter *both* sources of internet access. Here are some ways you can filter your internet connections.

## Your home internet connection

[OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com) provide a free parental filtering service called *FamilyShield* which includes the filtering of porn. The filter works because you set it up on your home modem/router. The assumption is that all of your home devices access the internet via the modem/router so it's a reliable gateway for filtering content. 

The other great thing OpenDNS do is take you step-by-step configuring your router. They have instructions for nearly every model so you really don't have an excuse not to try and get this set up. Head on over to https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/?url=familyshield and follow the instructions. 

Remember, in the instructions they will ask you to add the *IP addresses* for the DNS servers. You should enter the FamilyShield DNS servers which are [on the page above](https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/?url=familyshield), but repeated here too for convieience:
